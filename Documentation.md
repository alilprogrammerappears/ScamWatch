## 1.0 Introduction
### 1.1 The Issue

<p>Today, thousands of people are getting scammed online every day, costing victims millions of dollars and often destroying lives. For example, in 2022, the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre received nearly 71,000 reports and estimate that only up to 10% of fraud victims submit a report. Of the reported victims, the total monetary amount lost was approximately $500 million (Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2023). This does not account, however, for the emotional and mental trauma these scams inflict.</p>

<p>In many scams, for example refund and tech support scams, the first critical goal of the scammer is to have the victim download a remote connection software and connect to their computer. From there, the details of the scam can vary, however, regardless of the persuasion tactics and the details of the scam, once this connection has been made, the scammer has full control over the victim’s computer and access to any stored private information.</p>

<p>Furthermore, many of RCA applications auto-run on start-up and stay minimized in the background, which means that the connection can be re-established provided the target’s computer is on and the software is running. Ultimately, this connection can result in identity fraud, bank account and other financial information access, ransomware attacks and installation of malicious software, extortion, and more.</p>

<p>While there are many people who can identify and avoid falling for these scams, there are many people who are unable to. These people may be older, have medical or health issues, are financially struggling, or are simply inexperienced or uneducated in cybersecurity and digital technology. These people can very easily be lured into these scams and be taken advantage of.</p>
