- Python is case-sensitive. For checking if a process is running, make sure to convert the target and listed process names to lowercase (.lower())
<br>

- Python best practice is snake_case not camelCase and define the functions before running the script. So, functions at top of file.

- The following folder structure is proposed:

Application
- main.py
- function_1.py
- function_2.py
- ...
- exe_name_list.py
